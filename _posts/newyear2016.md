Happy Hew Year
============

###Greetings in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!
 
As I sit here and reflect on the past year, I am somewhat breathless as I think about all God has done and all that has happened both in the Brash family and in Curaçao. We look forward to the New Year with great anticipation that we will see another year of exciting ministry.

We want to thank you for you support during the past year. Without your prayer, logistical, and financial support, we would not have been able to participate in what God is doing in Curaçao. As we look forward to 2016, there are a few things we are praying for.
 
Richard will be in Curaçao from January 19th through February 1st. Alphonso Porter, the Caribbean field strategy coordinator, will join him. Together with Jonathan Petrus, they will meet with the Board of Directors for the VPCO. The VPCO is a Foundation that runs the only four Protestant Christian schools in Curaçao. The church in Curaçao is hoping to build a partnership with this organization to join them in their quest to bring Christ to families in Curaçao through their children. Please pray for the meeting on January 20th as well as other meetings we hope will spring from this meeting with the board.
 
We plan to return to Curaçao again this summer. Our mission this time will be to help host W&W teams and evangelism events in order to strengthen and grow the church the membership. Additionally, we will work on acquiring language skills and developing relationships with local foundations and people. Stay tuned for more information and developments on this front. Please pray that God's will is clear and our resolve is steady to complete the work He has called us to.
 
Finally, we want to wish you a very happy and blessed New Year. We pray that God bless you and your families with a fresh hunger to live holy as He is holy.

Many Blessings,

**Richard and Karen Brash**
